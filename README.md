<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A reactions component similar to Facebook/LinkedIn built using React.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57726348/142758596-6e8f184b-1531-48b8-91b7-da0d9443865a.png)

## Props

* `reactions`: Array of objects containing reaction. Each object must have `emoji` and `name` properties. You can add more properties to a reaction object but `emoji` and `name` are required. When a reaction is clicked, the function passed in the `onSelect` prop is called with the reaction object as the argument.

* `onSelect`: Function to be called when a reaction is clicked. The function is called with the reaction object (the object that is part of the reactions array) as the argument.

* `reactionCounts`: Array of objects containing reaction counts. Each object must have `emoji`, `count` and `active` properties. The `active` property determines whether to add "active" styles to the reaction. You can add more properties to each of the objects. When a reaction is clicked, the function passed in the `onSelect` prop is called with the reaction object as the argument.
